## Solution Component Options
DC Health Link&#39;s software suite is an open source, built-to-purpose system designed, developed and architected by DC Health Link&#39;s Application Development (AppDev) team.  HIX Community member partners will be able to enjoy the same high-performing, reliable, and scalable solution as DC Health Link.

The following components of DC Health Link&#39;s software suite are available to HIX Community partners:

* **Enrollâ€‹ application**: a full-service e-commerce website supporting Individual and Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) marketplace that enables individuals, assisters/administrators, employers, employees, brokers to register and enroll in benefits.
* **Cloud infrastructure**: a flexible, secure infrastructure to host DC Health Link applications in the Amazon Web Services cloud.  The infrastructure design enables software deployment with zero downtime, auto-scaling based on traffic load, real-time performance and error monitoring/recovery and automated deployment using Chef, Capistrano and other related tools.
* **Flexible system interfaces**: a Service-oriented architecture (SOA) and XML schema-backed Canonical Vocabulary standard that enables interoperability and information sharing between HBX sub-systems and services.
* **HIX enrollment system of record**: technology that initially tracked, and later mitigated, errors (duplication, missing/incorrect information, invalid transactions) introduced by upstream, Web-facing enrollment systems.  The resulting system is now the reference enrollment database for the DC Health Link.
* **EDI operations**: applications which defined and were developed using Electronic Data Interchange specifications and guidance documents for exchanging benefit enrollment and premium billing information. The guidelines are an adaptation of the ASC X12 5010 specifications.
