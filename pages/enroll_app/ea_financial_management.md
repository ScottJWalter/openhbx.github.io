## List Billing Premium Calculations

Our system calculates member-level age-based premiums for all medical and dental plans.  Employers see the full premium, the employer portion of the premium, and the employee-paid portion of the premium in their employer portal and on the monthly invoice.  During plan shopping, employees see their portion of premiums (after employer contributions have been applied) for all available medical and dental plans.  

## Invoice Generation

Invoices are available electronically to employers, brokers, and general agencies.  Invoices are mailed to the employer.

Quotes are generated and distributed electronically, with the ability to download as PDF or spreadsheet currently in development.
