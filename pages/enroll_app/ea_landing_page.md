The system is comprised of two core components: 1) Enroll Application for employer benefit design, roster management and employee enrollment, and 2) EDI Application for Health (and dental) Insurance Exchange (HIX).  The new system launched on-schedule in October 2015 and helped DC Health Link achieve a highly-successful 2016 open enrollment season.

Built-to-Purpose System 


## SHOP Solution Overview

DC Heath Link proposes to establish a collaborative state-to-state partnership with the Health Connector. This initiative will provide a fully-operational, Health Connector-branded SHOP Marketplace that is ACA-compliant and configurable to meet the Health Connector’s needs. Additionally, DC Heath Link’s open source software approach will save months of project start-up and mobilization time compared with procurement and integration of COTs products 

A collaborative, state-to-state partnership puts the Health Connector in complete control of its own highly-responsive, built-to-purpose system that is capable of rapid (hours, not days) deployment, and provides configuration options necessary to support the Health Connector policies and requirements. Like DC Health Link, the Health Connector will own its asset. Open source software licensing assures that the Health Connector will maintain access to the software code.  The Health Connector would also enjoy access to substantial system enhancements which have already been programmed into the District’s 2016/2017 development roadmap. 

The system’s highly configurable design, which includes self-service employer registration, roster management, benefit package design, ACA-compliant eligibility verification, plan shopping, notices, premium billing, and EDI transactions, enables the Health Connector to customize and extend functionality to fit its business needs. 

The system will be hosted in a Health Connector-dedicated, secure, commercial cloud that is highly available and dynamically scalable with proven performance in production. 

DC Health Link understands the importance of meeting deadlines and by providing its highly experienced development and implementation team to the Health Connector, is committed to Massachusetts’s success.
