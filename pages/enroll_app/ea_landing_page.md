DC Health Link is the state-based exchange and sole health and dental benefits distribution channel for both Individual and Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) marketplaces in the District of Columbia.  

DC Health Link SHOP market includes small employers with 50 or fewer employees and Congress, with enrollment rosters with thousands of subscribers.  Already supporting the largest SHOP enrollment base among the state-based exchanges, DC Health Link is projected to service more than 100,000 SHOP market covered lives by mid-2017.  

## Background

DC Health Link’s first generation system consisted of several Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) applications.  A large systems integrator was engaged to ensure these dissimilar systems would be able to communicate and function together transparently to our customers.  DC Health Link opened for business on time October 1, 2013 for both SHOP and individual marketplace customers.

Not long after the system launched, it became apparent that the task of integrating dissimilar COTS applications, with all of their complexities and proprietary elements, was going to be much more challenging than had been anticipated. These experiences were not unique to DC Health Link.  The story is very similar to many other state-based exchanges that launched using COTS systems. Integration delays, deployment issues, and lack of scalability due to limited design and infrastructure created a difficult user experience for some of our customers. 

The issues faced by DC Health Link and its customers, when combined with significant annual licensing and maintenance fees made it clear that the original solution would not be sustainable.

At the close of the second open enrollment season in February 2015, DC Health Link made the decision to begin replacing its COTS system with an open source architecture application for both the Individual and SHOP marketplaces. This new system would need to be robust and completely configurable to accommodate future changes in the marketplace.  

DC Health Link engaged Ideacrew, a local, highly innovative development team to design, build and operate its core mission technology systems, including: benefit enrollment, plan shopping, premium billing, notices, and analytics and reporting. The team now supports the DC Health Link enterprise with full-service technology, strategic planning, business analysis, architecture design, system integration, cloud engineering and operation (DevOps), software development, and system testing.

During a seven-month period in 2015, working with DC Health Link's Business stakeholders, the IdeaCrew team developed a new e-commerce Web site for DC Health Link, replacing the underperforming legacy system with a high-performance, reliable, and scalable solution.  The new system is comprised of two core components: 1) Enroll Application for employer benefit design, roster management and employee enrollment, and 2) EDI Application for Health Insurance Exchange (HIX).  The new system launched on-schedule in October 2015 and helped DC Health Link achieve a highly-successful 2016 open enrollment season.

Using open source software and shifting data center operations to the commercial cloud, the new systems immediately reduced costs through elimination of expensive legacy system licenses, change orders, and recurring maintenance fees. 
Given 2015’s successful transition, DC Health Link uniquely understands how to set up and operate with Massachusetts’s Health Connector, a shared technology and operational services model for a next-generation small group health insurance marketplace. 

## SHOP Solution Overview

DC Heath Link proposes to establish a collaborative state-to-state partnership with the Health Connector. This initiative will provide a fully-operational, Health Connector-branded SHOP Marketplace that is ACA-compliant and configurable to meet the Health Connector’s needs. Additionally, DC Heath Link’s open source software approach will save months of project start-up and mobilization time compared with procurement and integration of COTs products 

A collaborative, state-to-state partnership puts the Health Connector in complete control of its own highly-responsive, built-to-purpose system that is capable of rapid (hours, not days) deployment, and provides configuration options necessary to support the Health Connector policies and requirements. Like DC Health Link, the Health Connector will own its asset. Open source software licensing assures that the Health Connector will maintain access to the software code.  The Health Connector would also enjoy access to substantial system enhancements which have already been programmed into the District’s 2016/2017 development roadmap. 

DC Health Link believes deeply in the concept of strong, sustainable state-based health care marketplaces. DC Heath Link’s approach offers the Health Connector an innovative solution that provides a Web-based system supporting the Health Connector’s core mission technology systems.  

The system’s highly configurable design, which includes self-service employer registration, roster management, benefit package design, ACA-compliant eligibility verification, plan shopping, notices, premium billing, and EDI transactions, enables the Health Connector to customize and extend functionality to fit its business needs. 

The system will be hosted in a Health Connector-dedicated, secure, commercial cloud that is highly available and dynamically scalable with proven performance in production. 

DC Health Link understands the importance of meeting deadlines and by providing its highly experienced development and implementation team to the Health Connector, is committed to Massachusetts’s success.
