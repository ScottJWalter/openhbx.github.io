The Enroll Application includes a notice generation engine that automates written customer communication using a four-part definition: 

1. Event trigger
2. Notice template
3. Recipients
4. Communication channel(s)

The event trigger specifies an action that will result in creation of a notice, such as an employee completing plan enrollment.  

The associated notice template defines the composition and layout of the written communication—both dynamic fields and boilerplate text.

The recipients list specifies who to include on the communication.  For example, a notice communication to an employer may be copied to their broker.

The communication channel(s) refer to the method of delivery.  This may include electronic delivery for customers who opt to go paperless and postal delivery for those who don’t.  Additionally, the system provides an override that specifies a notice be delivered via post if required by regulation or exchange policy.

Notices intended for postal delivery are transmitted to a print vendor for printing and mailing.  

## Secure Inbox

Enroll Application customers, including employers, employees and brokers, have a dedicated email inbox to receive, and in some cases transmit, secure messages between one another.   Using this approach. electronic communications that include PII or sensitive information don’t leave the system.  
When a customer receives an electronic message, the system transmits an email notification to their registered external email address that they have received a secure message and to visit their account inbox.
