## Plan Shopping

Employees have a streamlined plan shopping experience.  Eligibility is auto determined by matching the employee’s date of birth and SSN to the information provided on the employer’s roster.  Once matched to the roster, the employee is then able to shop for a plan if the employee is in an eligible enrollment period (i.e. open enrollment period or special enrollment period).  

In employee plan shopping, the employee can see all available plans with different levels of plan details and multiple filter/sorting options (i.e. by premium, by deductible, by carrier, by plan type, by metal level).  Employees can select up to three plans to compare side by side, or they can select to look at full plan details for any given plan.  All plan information that is included in the SERFF tempaltes is available for display in the plan shopping experience.

We are contiuously reviewing the plan shopping experience with our team of user interface experts to allow for informed plan selections and facilitate improved health insurance literacy of our customer base.  For example, we recently completed moderated user testing of our individual shopping experience.  Improvements based on moderated user testing for plan comparison will also be made to SHOP shopping.  We are also planning moderated user testing for employer and employee customers in SHOP.
