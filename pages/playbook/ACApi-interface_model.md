# Ensuring System Interoperability

As part of the development of the new DC Health Link e-commerce system in 2015, DCHBX&#39;s system architects specified an open source technology architecture and associated data model/canonical vocabulary standard that enables interoperability and information sharing between HBX sub-systems and services.

The Affordable Care Act API (ACApi) provides a taxonomy and Application Programming Interface (API) for Health Benefit Exchange (HBX) system components to access and exchange information. The ACApi is a key element of an event-driven Service-oriented architecture (SOA) that enables agencies to rapidly establish and extend cost-effective, online health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small businesses. The ACApi offers a flexible framework upon which to build, and is one in a set of reusable components that support core functions, promote interoperability, improve performance and help reduce cost of implementing and operating an HBX. The diagram below illustrates the RESTful Web interface model for the DCHBX.
