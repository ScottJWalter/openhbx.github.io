## Delivering Services Using the DCHBX Agile Playbook
In the time since the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority launched in October 2013, we have learned that there are many wrong ways, and one right way, to deliver effective health benefit technology services.  The Agile development methods used at DCHBX bring predictability and deliver high productivity solutions using [Lean principles](http://www.poppendieck.com/):

* **See the whole** - thinking backward from the future and forward to the next generation
* **Build integrity in** - using Test-Driven Development (TDD) to identify and fix bugs early
* **Respond to change** - Agile methods anticipate that requirements will change
* **Iterative and incremental development** – deliver working software with each iteration
* **Always on/always improving** – immediately addressing even the smallest inconsistency and having the ability to implement change as fast as the marketplace demands

These tenets — applied in concert with our business-centered, agile development approach — reduce risk and result in a predictable technology solution deliverable, cost and time frame

## Addressing the risk of uncertainty
One of the most pervasive IT project challenges is uncertainty. The DCHBX Application Development team (AppDev) drives service delivery using [Lean principles](http://www.poppendieck.com/) and business-centered, Agile development methods.  A pillar in our Digital Playbook, this approach helps reduce risk and bring predictability to health benefit technology development.  Our experience has shown that these methods produce superior technology solutions, within committed timeframes and costs.

Many commercial software applications are developed using what is commonly referred to as the Waterfall method. In many ways, Waterfall resembles the linear, design/plan/build doctrine of a major construction project, and is entirely predicated upon knowing **all** system requirements up-front.  Typically, many months (or more) pass from the time business requirements are documented, to developing the software and finally, delivering a working system. It should be noted that the operative word here is &quot;working&quot;.  Under a Waterfall approach, development teams and stakeholders alike, may not know if the product will work as expected until the development process has concluded.  This approach may work well for constructing fixed structures such as roads or buildings, but in a constantly evolving business world, the serial progression of Waterfall, combined with lengthy time periods between collecting business needs and software delivery, results in a development process that&#39;s remarkably constrained and inflexible to change. The rigidity of this approach introduces uncertainty in the form of risk for delays, cost overruns and poor system behavior should the developer interpret requirements incorrectly or incompletely, or as is often the case, business needs change.

## DCHBX practices Agile Development to overcome many of Waterfall&#39;s vulnerabilities
Using our Agile development method, system requirements are rapidly prototyped to describe initial ideas and the requirements are provided to stakeholders in the form of Use Cases.  Use Cases describe functional requirements in the form of precise scenarios at the user&#39;s goal level.  Agile software development service cycles are iterative, with time periods between gathering Use Case requirements and releasing software measured in periods of weeks.  Larger projects are broken down into two or more iteration cycles, each culminating in delivery of useful software for system stakeholders.

At DCHBX, system design and development is conducted in a transparent manner, with stakeholders participating as co-developers.  Our AppDev team, with its many years of technology practice, has refined a business-driven software development process that brings predictability to health benefit technology.

Use of Agile development methods combined with [Lean principles](http://www.poppendieck.com/) provide stakeholders with high visibility during system development activities and enable collaboration between team members.   Our Partners in the HIX Community can rely on the delivery of a production system that fulfills business needs on-schedule and within budget.
